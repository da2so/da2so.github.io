## 1. What is the goal of GradCAM??

![1](https://da2so.github.io/assets/post_img/2020-08-10-GradCAM/1.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The goal of GradCAM is to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept (class).

## 2. GradCAM Method

GradCAM uses the gradients of any target concept (such as "cat") flowing into the final convolutional layer.

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
This formula $f(x) = x^2$ is an example.

$$
f(x) = x^2
$$

This formula $f(x) = x^2$ is an example.

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
